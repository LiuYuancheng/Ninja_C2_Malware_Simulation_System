### Introduction 

The Project Ninja is a cyber attack simulation toolkit designed for red team attackers to rapidly and dynamically develop and deploy various types of cyber attacks. The system is composed of a Command and Control (C2) hub and multiple distributed Trojan-Malware agents with below five main features: 

- **Polymorphic Malware Construction:** A simple agent with a C2 task synchronization interface and a library of malicious activity plugins allows for customized construction of various types of malware.
- **Centralized Control and Task Distribution:** The C2 task synchronization mechanism enables attackers to dynamically control the functions of different Ninja malware agents.
- **Dynamic Malware Action Code Execution:** Users(red team attacker) can dynamically plug in attack modules or even execute code sections during malware runtime.
- **Camouflage Actions and Trace Erasure:** The system disguises attack actions and communications as normal software operations and erases traces to evade defender track logs.
- **Malware Self-Protection:** A self-protection watchdog prevents the malware from being terminated or detected by anti-malware software.

The project consists of three sub-projects: Malicious Activities Module Repository, Ninja Malware Agent interface and Command and Control (C2) Orchestrator as shown below:

#### Malicious Activities Module Repository Introduction

The Malicious Activities Module Repository is a Python library containing various plugins for generating attack activities aimed at disrupting a computer, network, or service. All plugin modules can be executed individually or imported as functions to run within the [ Ninja Agent ] module, enabling the construction of more complex attack paths. The repository provides five types of attack modules:

- **Credentials Compromise Module**: These modules are used to compromise the target's security information by stealing files or scanning user traces. Functions include: `File/data stolen`, `Cmd history scanning`, `User password crack` and `Browser cookie hijacking`.
- **Phishing and Scam Module**: These modules generate phishing emails or scams to mislead users into downloading malicious resources or viewing malicious links. Functions include: `Phishing email generation`, `Scam Telegram message boom` , `backdoor/spy trojan` and `Scam popup advertisement generation`. 
- **Scan and Record Module**: These modules record user actions and scan the victim's network/target. Functions include: `Network scanning`, `Service probing`, `Traffic mirroring` , `Screen recording` and `Keyboard logging` .
- **Denial of Service Module**: These modules disable or interrupt the targeted victim's service. Functions include:  `ARP spoofing`, `Man in the middle` , `DDoS Attack`, `Hardware freeze/disable` and `Packet blocking `

- **Destruction Module** : These modules are used to destroy the target OS. Functions include: `File-sys destructing`, `Malware injection` , `FDI and FCI`, `malware protection watchdog` and `python-lib hijack`



#### Ninja Malware Agent Interface Introduction

The Ninja Malware Agent Interface is a lightweight agent interface that allows users to assemble various malicious plugins to build customized malware or run on the victim's system to dynamically download attack plugins from the [ Malicious Activities Module Repository ] . The agent provides four basic malware functions:

- **RTC2 Task Synchronization:** Automatically synchronizes attack tasks and schedules with the user's settings on RTC2.
- **RTC2 Communication Encryption:** Camouflages communication to avoid firewall detection and encrypts messages to prevent defenders from analyzing the traffic.
- **Action Camouflage and Code Obfuscation:** Camouflages attacks as normal user actions and obfuscates source code to prevent defenders from analyzing the code, even if they decompile the plugin module.
- **Trace Erasure and Self-Protection:** Erases attack traces to prevent defenders from analyzing logs and includes an embedded self-protection watchdog to prevent malware processes from being terminated or deleted.



#### Command and Control (C2) Orchestrator Introduction 

The C2 Orchestrator is the main control center for all malware agents and acts as the "bridge" between agents and the Malicious Activities Module Repository. It provides various dashboard UI and CGI interfaces for red team attackers to inject attack plugins into Ninja Malware agents, assign and schedule attacks, monitor attack progress, and review attack results. The dashboard is shown below:

All malware agents will register in RTC2. The main functions of the Orchestrator include: 

- **Malware Agent Management**: Allows the cyber exercise red team manager to enable/disable malware and manage the agents' attack plugin import process.

- **Assign & schedule the attack tasks**: Enables the cyber exercise red team attack implementation group to set up attack tasks, configure attack sequences/paths, and schedule attack times during the exercise.

- **Archive the result**: Allows the red team to view attack results, archive critical information and monitor attack progress.

### System Design 

The idea of the project name comes from a Japanese comic book "Naruto", this project offers various groups of centralized controlled "Ninja" malware designed for launching cyber attacks on specific targets. The reason why we call our software this name is because below feature: 

##### Design of Polymorphism Malware 

In the realm of Ninjas, each individual possesses fundamental skills like infiltration, complemented by specific specialties such as information gathering or assassination. Our system mirrors this concept, where all Ninja malwares inherit core functionalities from basic Ninja malware. The basic malware execute fundamental malicious actions like running commands, stealing files, and injecting malware onto the victim. Additionally, each advanced Ninja malware integrates with specialized modules for specific tasks, such as Modbus-FDI, Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, ARP spoofing, and system compromise. This modular approach enables the Ninjas to adapt and execute a diverse range of malicious actions tailored to particular objectives.

##### Centralized Control and Task Distribution

In every Ninja village, a shadow leader is responsible for task assignment to all other Ninjas. Similarly, in our system, the hacker assumes the role of the leader, leveraging a centralized controlled RTC2 (Red Team Command and Control) system. Through this system, the hacker can seamlessly allocate tasks to any of the "Ninja" via the bulletin board. The Ninjas, represented by malware entities, retrieve their tasks from the bulletin board and subsequently report the results of their task execution back to the same interface. All communications within this system are encrypted, ensuring secure transmission of information. The shadow leader can assign tasks from any location on the internet, and due to the indirect communication approach, even if defenders attempt to trace the communication, they would only be led to the bulletin board and not the direct interaction between the hacker and the malware.

##### Dynamic Malware Action Code Execution 

The Ninja possesses an arsenal of diverse weapons, and our system facilitates a dynamic attack action repository that allows for real-time integration. Hackers can seamlessly attach attack modules to tasks via the bulletin board. When a Ninja receives a task, it automatically equips the assigned attack module, enabling it to perform the specified attack action. For instance, a spy-trojan Ninja, designed for collecting credentials, can be enhanced with additional capabilities. If the hacker assigns a False Data Injection(FDI) task to it, the Ninja will dynamically download the necessary modules, such as the network scan module and Modbus-FDI module, transforming itself into an adept FDI attack program. This modular approach ensures adaptability and precision in executing a wide range of attack actions based on task assignments.

##### Camouflage Action and Trace Erase  

 Upon completion of a task, the Ninja efficiently erases any traces of its activities. The tasks assigned to the Ninja are saved the in the memory as a linked list, there is no code based tasks line and the malware only keep the pointer to the current task. For example if a Ninja got 4 tasks to break a system, when the Ninja malware finished the tasks and break the system, all the tasks data will be removed from the program execution memory the data store parameters will be cleared, so even the the defender detected error and "catch" the Ninja program, from the memory dump they will not able to reconstruct the tasks list from program or from the memory dump. 

##### Malware Execution Self Protection 

Engaging in a strategic confrontation with defenders, each Ninja is paired with a Ninja-dog, functioning as a program protection watchdog. If the Ninja malware is killed/deleted by the anti malware program or the user, the Ninja-dog will recover the Ninja malware automatically. At the same time if a Ninja detected it is recovered from a Ninja-dog, it will start a sub process to active the self protection feature: lock the victim's mouse+keyboard input, freeze screen and start to use garbage to full fill the memory to cause a slowdown in the system's performance. These defensive mechanisms enhance the resilience and adaptability of the Ninjas in the face of countermeasures initiated by defenders.
